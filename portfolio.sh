I'm a software developer and content creator, who builds engaging websites like this on and makes YouTube videos about computer science & software engineering. After graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, I am working professionally as a software engineer in Microsoft. While doing all of that, I documentned my coding journey on YouTube - trying to enlighten the next generation of developers and help them navigate the crazy world that is software development & computer science. I have varied interest over the place and have a lot of hobbies like playing piano, guitar, going to the gym, swimming. I get bored too soon so I keep on picking up new things to do. I am actively looking to go into the freelancing field. Hoping that I would eventually make it big, I am trying to learn a lot right now. See you in the future!"
